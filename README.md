# Prune Thiry Porfolio
## Initialisation 
Clone the repository of the project. Then launch the index.html file. 

## About
This repository serves as a repository for my portfolio. This project also allows me to complete the 5th and final project for FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Design Web Certification.  
The portfolio contains iframes that allow you to preview my other projects for this certification. You can also [find them here](https://github.com/Lrigami/FreeCodeCamp-Projects).  
Please refer to their own Readme.md file for more information on these projects.

I wanted to design a portfolio on the theme of space, which is close to my heart. I'm passionate about quantum physics and astronomy, subjects I read about very regularly. However, I wanted a lighter design, somewhere between a sketch and a doodle, with bright colours.

### To-do list
- [ ] Language switch button;
- [ ] Day-Night mode switch button (with another light design);
- [ ] All the projects within the iframes should be responsive;
- [ ] Planet animation when the user click on a planet;

### Attributions
I designed all the images in this portfolio, except for the logos I took from [icones8](https://icones8.fr/).
