# FreeCodeCamp Certification Project intitulated "Tribute Page"

## Initialisation 
Clone the repository of each project. Then launch the index.html file. \
If you want to use the automatised translation, you need a free DeepL API key. [You can find more information about it here](https://support.deepl.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020695820-API-Key-for-DeepL-s-API#h_01HM9MFQ195GTHM93RRY63M18W).

## Instructions for the project : 

User Stories:

1. - [x] Your tribute page should have a main element with a corresponding id of main, which contains all other elements
2. - [x] You should see an element with an id of title, which contains a string (i.e. text), that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug")
3. - [x] You should see either a figure or a div element with an id of img-div
4. - [x] Within the #img-div element, you should see an img element with a corresponding id="image"
5. - [x] Within the #img-div element, you should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in #img-div
6. - [x] You should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page
7. - [x] You should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site, that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab
8. - [x] Your #image should use max-width and height properties to resize responsively, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size
9. - [x] Your img element should be centered within its parent element

What I want to add to this project to make it more personal and deepened :

- [x] Being able to choose the language of the page. The text will change automatically. --> Use of the free version of DeepL API (problems of CrossOrigin for now)
- [x] Design a better timeline : on the left the bio aspects, on the right the literary ones. 
- [x] Add a sliding div that contains the published books by the author. Users can scroll right or left.
- [x] Add a better design so the colors are matching. Put the photo of Ogawa YÃ´ko and the sliding div in a asymetric frame.
- [x] Responsive design

/!\ To make the translation button work, you need a free DeepLAPI key. /!\
